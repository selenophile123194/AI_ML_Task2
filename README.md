# Task: Stock Market Data Analysis using yFinance

## ðŸ“Œ Objective
The goal of this task is to fetch, analyze, and visualize historical stock market data using the `yfinance` Python library.  
We aim to observe stock trends, calculate basic statistics, and visualize performance over time.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
- **Source:** Yahoo Finance API (via `yfinance` Python library)  
- **Fetched Data Includes:**
  - Open price
  - Close price
  - High & Low prices
  - Trading volume
  - Date range specified in the script

---

## ðŸ›  Steps Performed
1. **Installed and imported required libraries:**
   - `yfinance` for data retrieval
   - `pandas` for data handling
   - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for visualizations

2. **Fetched historical data** for selected stock tickers (e.g., `AAPL`, `GOOG`, `MSFT`).

3. **Performed basic exploratory analysis:**
   - Checked first few rows of the data
   - Calculated moving averages (7-day, 30-day)

4. **Visualized stock trends:**
   - Close price over time
   - Moving average comparison

## ðŸ“Š Key Insights
- Moving averages provide a smoother trend line for better decision-making.
- Stocks exhibit clear upward or downward trends over selected time frames.
